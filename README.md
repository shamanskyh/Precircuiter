## Binary Download
Coming soon to the Mac App Store.

## Caveats
- Precircuiter needs to know where outlets are. These must be added to your Vectorworks plot as lighting instruments with "Power" as their device type. This only needs to be done once and saved as part of your venue's template.
- Precircuiter doesn't support flyspaces (yet), or any venue where grouped receptacles travel in a bunch.
